# Bytify

The project mainly focus on building a **Assembly language simulator** with **MIPS** architecture.

## Functions support in phase 1

- Mips operations
  - Arithmetic
  - Bitwise
  - Initializing
  - Branch
  - Memory
  - Printing
- GUI to show them
- Edit option in instructions

## Functions supported in phase 2

- Pipeline simulated
- pipeline visualized
- Average CPI
- Data-forwarding information
- Stalls information

## Functions supported in phase 3

- Two level cache
- File uploading in GUI
- Restart option
- Total HIT rate of Level 1 and Level 2 cache

### Programming Language used

`Python`

### How to start?

- Check Rules.md for basic rules to follow
- Check Manual.md for instruction set and how to use them.
- Check Pipeline.md for information on pipelining
- Check Cache.md for information on cache

### Further Improvements that can be done

- Adding functionality of hexa numbers
- Making GUI more interactive
- Adding run time error detection methods.
- Making all the 5 functions of pipelining parallel to implement pipelining.
- Adding some design to add more level of cache

### Drawbacks

- Using memory as integer not character as most operations were on integers.
- Unable to add hexadecimal

### Bubble Sort code is given to test

### cache information is given to upload
